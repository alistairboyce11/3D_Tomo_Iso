# 3D_Tomo_Iso


Quick matlab scripts to render isosurfaces in 3D seismic tomography model

mk_synth_3d_plot.m
Makes 3D synthetic model used for resolution test 
Renders in 3D using Iso surfaces.


Loads latest 3D grid of tomography model
Applies some smoothing, picks dVp = -0.5% velocity contour
Makes 3D model to plot

Tried python - failed
